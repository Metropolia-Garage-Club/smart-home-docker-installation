# Dashboards

To create a new dashboard:

**Settings -> Dashboards -> Add Dashboard -> select the type you want and give it a name**

**Note:**

- Overview -> Provides compact version (Used in my examples)
- From scratch -> You can edit the layout but there may be gaps between cards

Steps to edit the dashboard:

- Go to dashboard that you created.
- Click on **Edit dashboard** (upper right-hand corner)
- If you are using the **overview** type, you need to **take control** to edit the dashboard(by default, it is owned by home assistant)
- In edit mode, you can add cards (Everything on a dashboard is a card)
