# Home Assistant Mobile App

- Download the Home Assistant mobile app
- Log in to the account using the URL
    - In my setup, I use my laptop's IP address because Home Assistant is running locally 
    - **Important:** Both your phone and the HA must be on the **same network**)
- Then log in to the account 
**(Note:** If you use a Google-suggested password as your password, it won't work here because it saved with Google, not in Home Assistant.
